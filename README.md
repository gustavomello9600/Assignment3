# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The assignment related files are located in both the root and the /steps directories. I opted for explaining the data cleaning and analysing process also in the run_analysis.R file trhough code comments. The corresponding outputs of the five intermediate steps demanded to get to the final dataset are the content of the /steps directory.

In the CodeBook.md markdown file, I described the variables as they appear in the final "tidy_data" dataset and summarized the cleaning process.
