# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The assignment related files are located in both the root and the "steps" directories. I opted for explaining the data cleaning and analysing process in the run_analysis.R code itself. The corresponding outputs of the five intermediate steps demanded to get to the final dataset are the content of the "steps" directory.

In the CodeBook.md markdown file, I describe the variables as they appear in the final "tidy_data" dataset.
